# Requirements
`date`
# To run
Get inside the `snake/` directory and run the file called `./snake`. You have to be in that directory because `snake` opens a relative `snake_required`
# Info
You can move using **`wasd`** or **`hjkl`**. As your length increases the game speeds up. After getting the whole grid you win :)

If you want you can change map_width/ map_height lines 16,17 inside `snake_required`
