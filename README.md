# Requirements
`bc`
# To run
Get inside the `snake/` directory and run the file called `./snake`. You have to be in that directory because `snake` opens a relative `snake_required`
# Info
You can move using **wasd** or **hjkl**. As your length increases the game speeds up. After getting the whole grid you win :)
